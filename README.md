# THE SUPER TINY COMPILER

Welcome to The Super Tiny Compiler. It's an ultra simplified example of all the
major pieces of a modern compiler written in easy to read JavaScript. Reading
through it can help you learn about how most compilers work end to end.

### Why should I care?

That's fair, most people don't really have to think about compilers in their day
jobs. However, compilers are all around you, tons of the tools you use are based
on concepts borrowed from compilers.

### But compilers are scary!

Yes, they are. But that's our fault (the people who write compilers), we've
taken something that is reasonably straightforward and made it so scary that
most think of it as this totally unapproachable thing that only the nerdiest of
the nerds are able to understand.

### Okay so where do I begin?

Awesome! Head on over to the [super-tiny-compiler.js](super-tiny-compiler.js)
file.

### I'm back, that didn't make sense

Ouch, I'm really sorry. I'm planning on doing a lot more work on this to add
inline annotations. If you want to come back when that's done, you can either
watch/star this repo or follow me on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/thejameskyle) for updates.

### Tests

Run with `node test.js`
